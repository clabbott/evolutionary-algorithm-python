# iteration 0
# goal: create looping structure that runs NUM times and prints status each time 

# iteration 1 
# goal: create object that holds the value of the environment and have it change with time 

# iteration 2 
# goal: hold values in the ENVIRONMENT representing the population 
# principle: the ENVIRONMENT will interact with itself constantly. The population of the ENVIRONMENT creates FORCES
# principle: the ENVIRONMENT doesn't hold FORCES that act on it, just its reaction to those FORCES, e.g. the population
# principle: FORCES do not persist between cycles; if a FORCE should logically persist, it exists as a part of the ENVIRONMENT

# iteration 3
# goal: insert members of the population into the simulation

# iteration 4 
# goal: define what I want to do with this thing 
# principle: this is a tool to throw a problem at. Given a problem, the environment will naturally select until a solution is found. 
# principle: the tool doesn't know the solution, it sees an input-output box with input being a guess and the output being a response
# principle: smaller responses are better 
# principle: ideal question will give different outputs for each input
# principle: it will solve quadratic equations 

# iteration 5
# goal: create a quadratic equation black box function
